    "Build a linear model predicting the star rating based on the count of the words in each document (bag-of-words model).  Use a [`CountVectorizer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) to produce a feature matrix giving the counts of each word in each review.  Feed the feature matrix into a linear model, such as `Ridge` or `SGDRegressor`, to predict the number of stars from each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "1. Don't forget to use tokenization!  This is important for good performance but it is also the most expensive step.  Try vectorizing as a first initial step and then running grid-search and cross-validation only on of this pre-processed data.  `CountVectorizer` has to memorize the mapping between words and the index to which it is assigned.  This is linear in the size of the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "text = [row['text'] for row in data]\n",
    "X = CountVectorizer().fit_transform(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, this can be run with many different parameters\n",
    "# without needing to retrain the vectorizer:\n",
    "model.fit(X, stars, hyperparameter=something)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try choosing different values for `min_df` (minimum document frequency cutoff) and `max_df` in `CountVectorizer`.  Setting `min_df` to zero admits rare words which might only appear once in the entire corpus.  This is both prone to overfitting and makes your data unmanageably large.  Don't forget to use cross-validation to select the right value.  \n",
    "3. Try using [`LinearRegression`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression) or [`RidgeCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV).  If the memory footprint is too big, try switching to [Stochastic Gradient Descent](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor) You might find that even ordinary linear regression fails due to the data size.  Don't forget to use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) to determine the regularization parameter!  How do the regularization parameter `alpha` and the values of `min_df` and `max_df` from `CountVectorizer` change the answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will likely pick up several hyperparameters between the tokenization step and the regularization of the estimator.  While it is more strictly correct to do a grid search over all of them at once, this can take a long time. Quite often, doing a grid search over a single hyperparameter at a time can produce similar results.  Alternatively, the grid search may be done over a smaller subset of the data, as long as it is representative of the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, assemble a pipeline that will transform the data from records all the way to predictions.  This will allow you to submit its predict method to the grader for scoring."

       "[\"I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.\",\n",

Because we are dealing with a sparse matrix, we have to use [`TruncatedSVD`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD.html#sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD).  If we reduce the dimensions, we can use a more sophisticated models than linear ones.\n",

This allows you to focus your efforts on improving the important algorithms, and leaving the rest \"good enough\".\n",

    "One way to accomplish this is through ceiling analysis, which can be useful when you have a training set with ground truth values at each stage. Let's say you're training a model to extract image captions from websites and return a list of names that were in the caption. Your overall accuracy at some point reaches 70%. You can try manually giving the model what you know are the correct image captions from the training set, and see how the accuracy improves (maybe up to 75%). Alternatively, giving the model the perfect name parsing for each caption increases accuracy to 90%. This indicates that the name parsing is a much more promising target for further work, and the caption extraction is a relatively smaller factor in the overall performance.\n",

You might try this kind of analysis to determine how important adding stopwords and stemming to your NLP model actually is, and how that importance changes with parameters like the number of features."

    "We want to find collocations --- that is, bigrams that are \"special\" and appear more often than you'd expect from chance. We can think of the corpus as defining an empirical distribution over all *n*-grams.  We can find word pairs that are unlikely to occur consecutively based on the underlying probability of their words. Mathematically, if $p(w)$ be the probability of a word $w$ and $p(w_1 w_2)$ is the probability of the bigram $w_1 w_2$, then we want to look at word pairs $w_1 w_2$ where the statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ \\frac{p(w_1 w_2)}{p(w_1) p(w_2)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "is high.  Return the top 100 (mostly food) bigrams with this statistic with the 'right' prior factor (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating the probabilities is simply a matter of counting, and there are number of approaches that will work.  One is to use one of the tokenizers to count up how many times each word and each bigram appears in each review, and then sum those up over all reviews.  You might want to know that the `CountVectorizer` has a `.get_feature_names()` method which gives the string associated with each column.  (Question for thought: Why doesn't the `HashingVectorizer` have a similar method?)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Questions:* This statistic is a ratio and problematic when the denominator is small.  We can fix this by applying Bayesian smoothing to $p(w)$ (i.e. mixing the empirical distribution with the uniform distribution over the vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does changing this smoothing parameter affect the word pairs you get qualitatively?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can interpret the smoothing parameter as adding a constant number of occurrences of each word to our distribution.  Does this help you determine set a reasonable value for this 'prior factor'?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For fun: also check out [Amazon's Statistically Improbable Phrases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistically_Improbable_Phrases).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Implementation note:*\n",
    "As you adjust the size of the Bayesian smoothing parameter, you will notice first nonsense phrases being removed and then legitimate bigrams being removed, leaving you with only generic bigrams.  The goal is to find a value of the smoothing parameter between these two transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference solution is not an aggressive filterer: it errors in favor of leaving apparently nonsensical words. On further consideration, many of these are actually somewhat meaningful. The smoothing parameter chosen in the reference solution is equivalent to giving each word 30 previous appearances prior to considering this data.  This was chosen by generating a list of bigrams for a range of smoothing parameters and seeing how many of the bigrams were shared between neighboring values.  When the shared fraction reached 95%, we judged the solution to have converged.  Note that `min_df` should not be set too high, where it could exclude these borderline words."
