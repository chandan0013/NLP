    "Build a linear model predicting the star rating based on the count of the words in each document (bag-of-words model).  Use a [`CountVectorizer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) to produce a feature matrix giving the counts of each word in each review.  Feed the feature matrix into a linear model, such as `Ridge` or `SGDRegressor`, to predict the number of stars from each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "1. Don't forget to use tokenization!  This is important for good performance but it is also the most expensive step.  Try vectorizing as a first initial step and then running grid-search and cross-validation only on of this pre-processed data.  `CountVectorizer` has to memorize the mapping between words and the index to which it is assigned.  This is linear in the size of the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "text = [row['text'] for row in data]\n",
    "X = CountVectorizer().fit_transform(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, this can be run with many different parameters\n",
    "# without needing to retrain the vectorizer:\n",
    "model.fit(X, stars, hyperparameter=something)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try choosing different values for `min_df` (minimum document frequency cutoff) and `max_df` in `CountVectorizer`.  Setting `min_df` to zero admits rare words which might only appear once in the entire corpus.  This is both prone to overfitting and makes your data unmanageably large.  Don't forget to use cross-validation to select the right value.  \n",
    "3. Try using [`LinearRegression`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression) or [`RidgeCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV).  If the memory footprint is too big, try switching to [Stochastic Gradient Descent](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor) You might find that even ordinary linear regression fails due to the data size.  Don't forget to use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) to determine the regularization parameter!  How do the regularization parameter `alpha` and the values of `min_df` and `max_df` from `CountVectorizer` change the answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will likely pick up several hyperparameters between the tokenization step and the regularization of the estimator.  While it is more strictly correct to do a grid search over all of them at once, this can take a long time. Quite often, doing a grid search over a single hyperparameter at a time can produce similar results.  Alternatively, the grid search may be done over a smaller subset of the data, as long as it is representative of the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, assemble a pipeline that will transform the data from records all the way to predictions.  This will allow you to submit its predict method to the grader for scoring."

Our drinks were finished so we ordered more.Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.So we reminded her again.My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well.My partners shrimp though was awful.It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead.They consistently serve quality food along with good service.\",\n",

I got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard.  The salmon with the Caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!

This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around.\\nOk..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.\\nAfter the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.\\n\\nAppetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...\\n\\nMy forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish. I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\\nMore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!\\n\\nAs the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server\\n We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you..

It's rich and exotic and mysterious and... goddamn exciting. \\n\\nIG is a Chinese American restaurant in the burbs of burbs that serves burbanites, but man it had that feeling.\\n\\nThe Russian friend and I went there on a Sunday night for their Peking Duck special. We got that and some appetizer platter and some wonton soup and some cocktails. None of it was particularly memorable, and in fact the Peking Duck skin was *not* crispy, but the presentation was spot on. There's been so much streamlining of Asian restaurants that nice chairs and big booths with lots of room is uncommon. And on top of it I am a sucker for ethnic restaurants that have good servers that can connect with customers. Do you know how rare that is? Take advantage and talk it out. Be polite and get good service.\\n\\nI don't think Madison's foodies would give this place four stars.

The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\\n\\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\\n\\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices. If you're looking for good Chinese in town, check out Hong Kong Cafe on Regent or Orient House on South Park instead.\",\n",

       " \"At its best the Bristled Boar is a great place to go with friends for an after-work drink or three, and maybe a game of pool or darts or just watch the game.  At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  \\n\\nFortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\\n\\nThere are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.\",\n",

The race began Friday, so we arrived late Thursday afternoon and left in the morning.\\n\\nReservations were made months in advance and were honored when we got there. Check-in was simple and the employees seemed to enjoy our enthusiasm and joking around. They even welcomed us with fresh cookies. How can you hate on a hotel with cookies? You just can't.\\n\\nThe location, strangely enough, was both ideal and not. The nice thing was that we were close enough to the starting line that it wasn't a huge issue for our first group of runners to leave at 5am and get there on time; however, being somewhat closer to where the race started might have been nicer and we're looking into that for 2013, because it was a bit of a haul for the second van (my van).\\n\\nOn the other hand, we were far enough away that this hotel did not fill up immediately and it had no problem blocking off some rooms for us and we were right off the highway, very close to restaurants for an easy group dinner and there is a shopping center right next door. I took full advantage of stocking up on anything I might have missed by going to the local Erehwon and running shop. That was incredibly convenient. They also have a really good continental breakfast.\\n\\nAs far as the hotel room: the beds were incredibly comfortable but the shower drain was backed up. I ended up in a couple inches of dirty water, which is never fun. However, I had some of the best sleep of my life.

Which, if you can\\'t tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.

And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful \"contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained\" feeling afterwards.  \\n\\nA quick rundown on other items I\\'ve tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino\\'s a mile away if you\\'re craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut\\'s deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The \"Philly\" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.\\n\\nThe best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.

All new equipment and works great. \\n\\nI have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \\n\\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. \\n\\nI have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\\n\\nI have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.\\n\\nThe only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot.

       " \"For a salon with a name as refreshing as Tangles Salon, this business sure has a its Goldilocks well....tangled. Although this location carries the Aveda name, it appears to be buckling under its weight. There are many issues at this salon, and only a few will be mentioned here.\\n\\nTangles Salon has had a somewhat tortured existence here in the Madison area, what with experiencing not-so-smooth management changes, relocating attempts, massive employee walkouts, and even a fire in the past 2 years alone. One begins to wonder how they have stayed afloat as long as they have.\\n\\nAfter a devastating fire destroyed Tangles, it was clear that many once loyal customers had been caught in the middle of the chaos. Some arrived at the salon for their appointments, only to find the building in charred ruins, and most never got a courtesy call from the owners. Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.\\n\\nA receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.\\n\\nOn the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.\\n\\nI wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.\",\n",

I received a shellac manicure, partial highlight and conditioning treatment and based on what I spent on the Living Social coupon I am satisfied with the results, but if I had paid full price for these services I would be very dissatisfied.  \\n\\nThere was just something \"off\" about my entire experience at Tangles.  The salon and nail room looked messy and unorganized, as did most of the hair stylists and nail technicians.  I didn\\'t get that \"Aveda vibe\" at all, more like the \"Cost Cutters vibe\" (nothing against CC, but if I\\'m paying $75 for highlights I\\'d like the atmosphere to match the price).

My office is only a mile or so away and it makes for a quick meal.  I must say, I feel like something has changed in the past year.  When I used to go, I felt like no matter what I ordered, it all looked/tasted the same. (ie sauce, color, vegetables, etc)  But for the past year or so, my coworker and I marvel at how great the food looks when it comes from the kitchen.  We primarily dine in.  We're practically giving each other high-fives, because we feel like we just scored big.\\n\\nAnd the flavor is just as good as it looks.  I just ate at another carryout Chinese location and the quality of food reminded me how great China Wok is, so I jumped out to right this review.\\n\\nI regularly get Kung Pao Chicken or Mongolian Beef.  My coworker exclusively gets General Tso's Chicken (this thing always looks amazing!)\\n\\nValue is always great...we can get both of our lunches, i usually add an egg roll (75 cents) and he usually gets a soda and it costs us around $12 for both of us.  Quantity of food is also great.\\n\\nAs you can tell, I highly recommend this place.  Given it's a carryout Chinese place, I really should give it 5 stars for overcoming such an obstacle!\",\n",
       " \"Good Chinese at an affordable price. They have the best lunch combos and the food is usually ready for pickup in 10 minutes. My food is always hot and have yet had any complaints with consistency.  Not the best Chinese out there but for the price it's pretty solid!\",\n",

Cars are backed up into the next parking lot.\\n\\nIf you insist on trying to eat there, I would suggest you go inside to eat, that way, when they invariably get your order wrong, you can throw it directly at them.  If you get drive-through you will end up like me, paying for a double cheeseburger only to get back to your desk and find out that they totally screwed you and only gave you a single.

The concept of taking one order, then making that order before taking or starting another order is not the concept of the way a fast food restraunt should be run.

We also got some guac which was made in a cool manner with some great ingredients table side. Delicious. When my vegetarian tamales finally came, I was already pretty full and managed to eat half of one and a yummy corn cake. The tamale was a little spicy for my taste, but not bad.

Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison\\'s finest.\\n\\nDetailed Review:\\nThe Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter\\'s Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot.  The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye.  \\n\\nWe put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange.  I\\'m sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish.  \\n\\nRegardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually.  So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn\\'t a problem.  Dexter\\'s recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. \\n\\nWe immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup.

The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could\\'ve been a little warmer.

She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us.  The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter\\'s doesn\\'t strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover.  \\n\\nCurds were excellent - not your typical \"from the bag\" curds, which was a nice surprise.

They had all sorts of games playing on the multiple tvs (not just basketball, hooray!) and my boyfriend was delighted to note that they have shuffleboard.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately (pretty good for a Friday night) and placed our drink orders. My boyfriend got a Great Lakes Irish Red something or other, and I ordered a Pyramid Winter Ale, which wasn't all that great. I personally wish that they had some more local stuff on the beer menu, but aside from that, I can't really complain about the selection.\\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered beer battered cod with carrot soup, and my boyfriend ordered a burger with chili garlic fries. Our food was AMAZING. This is hands down the best fish fry I've had outside of da nortwoods, definitely the best I've had in Madison so far. The soup was interesting but delicious - kind of spicy with a hint of cilantro. I didn't try my boyfriend's burger, but the chili garlic fries were awesome. I'm someone who believes that there is no such thing as too much garlic, though, so they might be a bit much for less of a garlic lover.\\n\\nI am so stoked to have found a great fish fry place so close to our house.

Nonetheless, Dexter's does it right.\\n\\nFresh, Bering sea cod enveloped in a crispy, salty batter keeps me dreaming of Fridays.  The clam chowder is phenomenal and so are the rest of their soups...obviously lovingly tended to and cooked from homemade stocks.  I could further pontificate, but no need...the execution in the kitchen is stellar.  \\n\\nNow, the beer list is exquisite in my opinion.  I love Madison, but many bars get so caught up on local-centric taps lists.  Consequently, more often than not, you walk in to see the taps jammed with Ale Ayslum, Lake Louie and Capital.  Not bad...but I'll be damned to say I could choke down another Hopalicious.  Dexters, on the other hand, opens their taps up to pretty much anything.  From Toppling Goliath (which I love, but you can't really get outside of Iowa and Wisco) to Belgian Flander's Reds, they kill it with their beer selection.  Also, I really respect that they let you know on the beer list what's on deck...this has kept me coming back many-a-times.  \\n\\nSo why not the 5-stars?  Well, we've run into some seriously long waits, both for a table and then for the fish.  If they could streamline a little more in the kitchen, I'd gladly give it that extra star.  In the mean time, we NEVER come here on Fridays after 6pm....forget it.  If you don't mind dining with the Greyhairs....you'll do just fine.\",\n",

We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday in Lent and knew we were already in trouble when parking was hard to find.  The dining room was packed and we were told there would be an hour wait.  Since we had driven across town, we decided to wait it out in the bar.  There is plenty of room to wait and have a beer from the huge selection they have.  In 30 minutes we were called for our table.  Two of us ordered the lake perch and one ordered the deep fried cod.  There is also baked cod, walleye, blue gill and shrimp to choose from.  The fish comes with your choice of  - baked potato, waffle fries, pub fries, homemade potato chips, and some other things like cottage cheese etc.  We had waffle fries, potato chips and the pub fries, which are beer pattered.  You also get a small container of cole slaw and a white grocery store roll.  There was a short wait for our fish, but the dining room was still packed.  When it arrived, it was hot, tasty and a generous serving.  We were all very satisfied with our dinner.  I thought the homemade potato chips were excellent, they came out warm and crispy.  The only thing I did not care for was the tartar sauce, can't place what it was, but had a funny taste to it to me.  Everyone that waited on us was friendly and efficient without being intrusive.  Wish this place was closer to my side of town, but we will definitely try it again.  Get there early or expect to wait!\",\n",

There is a wide variety of vegetarian options which is nice.  I also have to mention that I won't be eating here again soon as they have very recently taken my 2 favorite items off the menu; the tuna steak sandwich, and the cajun chicken sandwich.  The cumin chipotle mayonnaise on the tuna sandwich was one of the only reasons I would even still go to Monty's.\\n\\nThe service is always terrible.  you can count on a long wait for your waiter to take your order, for them to bring your drinks, and your food, and the longest wait of all is always for the check.  I have contemplated a dine and dash many times.  I counted the minutes one time, and it was 45 minutes from the time I finished eating to when the check came.  It wasn't because the waitress didn't see me from behind the counter either, she was talking to another server.  Once, I was eating with a friend, and we were waiting for 15 minutes to even have our waiter come to the table, so we just left.   Believe me, the service being slow is never because there isn't enough servers or too many diners.   \\n\\nThe food is decent, but it's not great by any means. It is still pretty okay, although I've had some bad meals.  The meatless meatloaf is only saved by the cashew gravy, and the salmon cakes are awful.  The tuna sandwich was really good, but the size and bun has changed over the years, and recently been replaced by 3 kinds of pastrami sandwiches.   The grilled chicken salad is good, as is the feta dill burger.\",\n",

Besides that, I\\'ve never noticed it being *especially* slow... just kind of slow, which doesn\\'t really bother me.\\n\\nLet me take a moment here to recommend the Meatloaf Sandwich: Get it served cold.  Just trust me here.  Do not get it hot.  I\\'ve had it served both ways: Cold, it is a sandwich so delicious that fireworks go off in your head; Warm, it is an open-faced abomination with gravy and mashed potatoes poured all over it.\\n\\nTheir cheeseburger was surprisingly good (I\\'d even go so far to say that it\\'s one of the best burgers I\\'ve had in Madison).  They had a special entree one evening, \"Cheeseburger Mac & Cheese,\" which was out of this world.  It really tasted like a cheeseburger over noodles!  They serve a great chef salad, have awesome spicy waffle fries, and I would die 100 times over for the buttermilk biscuits they serve with breakfast.  Their expansive dessert case is as tasty as it is impressive looking.\\n\\nI was beyond sold on this place one time when I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake for dessert.  It wasn\\'t a piece so much as it was a towering slab.  It was so tall, in fact, that it wasn\\'t until I\\'d eaten enough of it that I noticed that the waiter (who was wearing a mohawk and kilt) had written, \"Das ist Deutsch\" in chocolate on the plate.  \\n\\nI\\'ve had questionable service twice: Once was when I reserved a pie for a dinner I was going to and they did not have it when I got there, but tried to placate me by selling me a larger, more expensive pie.  That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, \"You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We don\\'t see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise.\"  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.  How about we don\\'t tip you at all?\\n\\nBut those two experiences aside, nothing has been able to lessen my love of Monty\\'s and all its glory.',\n",

About half of the menu is vegetarian-friendly, with a couple of vegan items as well.  The veggie meatloaf was the best of the food we ate (not including the pie), but the tempeh in the veggie BLT was nicely prepared too.  We didn't try breakfast items, but tofu scrambler was available and looked great.  The food was delicious, the desserts were enormous and divine, and we thought the service was fast and friendly.  We were there on a Sunday evening and a Monday lunch, and neither time did we wait for a table.

On the other hand I want to say Monty's is overrated. \\n\\nLet me explain. \\n\\nI love Monty's because of the options. If you are a vegetarian or vegan you aren't confined to the world of salads. There are many delicious and satisfying options. If you don't restrict your diet in any way, there are many great meaty and chalorically rich options for you too. Watching carbs? Get a sandwich in a wrap. Looking for a healthy lean meat option? Choose one of the several good chicken dishes. \\n\\nI personally steer towards the lean meat or veggie dishes and have never been disappointed. It's really hard to find a restaurant that caters to my needs as well as my boyfriend's nonrestrictive diet needs. This place does it well and at a pretty decent price. \\n\\nThough, I don't personally think Monty's is overrated, I feel that the point needs to be made. Whatever you order will be fresh and pretty tasty. However, say you order The Meatloaf of the Gods, it may not be what you expect if you are the type of person that is looking for traditional 'the-way-mom-made-it' meatloaf slathered with ketchup. If you are looking for an extensive breakfast menu consisting of traditional American breakfast combos (i.e. - a dish that contains ALL of the following: pancakes, eggs, hash browns, 3 kinds of meat and toast), Denny's or Perkin's may be a better option for you. \\n\\nThey put their own spin on the more traditional dishes and have created an awesome list of in-house specialties. Whether you eat meat or not you MUST try The Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. It's amazing. Like your beef? Definitely try the Blueplate Burger! Don't like beef so much but still want a burger? Try the Blueplate Burger with a locally made walnut burger. \\n\\nNo matter who you are, Monty's is worth a try.\",\n",

I used to go with my parents as a kid, and now as an adult I've started to rediscover how much I loved their food.\\n\\nNestled in the eclectic Atwood Ave neighborhood, Monty's presents a 50's style diner with yummy lunch specials like meatloaf (very good meatloaf), sandwiches, and a wicked good brunch.  They also have ridiculously delicious chocolate shakes, so don't be afraid to splurge while you're there.  \\n\\nOne of the other great things about Monty's is the atmosphere; the area around it is filled with little mom and pop shops, the Barrymore theater, and relics of an older time.  Take a stroll around if it's a nice day and your bound to find something you like.  If not, I'm sure you probably enjoyed the food as all the dishes I've ever had were great and the portions were generous.\\n\\nThere are a few drawbacks though that held me back from giving a 5 star review.  First, there is usually a very long wait.  The place is popular, but I don't feel that the food and eastside location (I live far westside) always justifies the overall experience.  Secondly, the service is hit or miss.  I've had some waitresses who were prompt and polite, making me feel right at home, and others who were sarcastically rude to the point where people in my party almost had to say something.  Furthermore, the kitchen doesn't always look clean, as trays of biscuits have been left sitting out and flies have been a buzzing.\\n\\nSetting all those things aside though (which I know may be hard for some), the blue plate is a Madison delight that should not be missed.

Good reuben for lunch too.\",\n",
       " \"If I had a friend from overseas come to visit, and he asked me to show him what good American food was like, I know without a doubt this would be the place that I would display to him with great national pride. Actually, I take all my friends who come to visit Madison to Monty's. I once had a friend visiting who was on a very strict diet (gluten free + fasting for lent) with me and she had a good three pages of vegetarian and gluten-free menu to choose from.\\n\\nThis shouldn't scare off those looking for a greasy spoon, however, because you're free to order something at the complete opposite of that spectrum. Bacon grilled cheese, donut french toast, chicken fried steak, alcoholic milkshakes...You name it, they probably have it. My one piece of advice is that you should probably look at the menu ahead of time because it is so expansive that you could spend as much as a half hour just trying to make up your mind.\\n\\nBe prepared to wait a long time if coming in during the weekend brunch rush. Do not be deterred, it is completely worth every second.\\n\\nFor what it's worth this is probably my #1 favorite restaurant in Madison, if not my favorite restaurant ever.\",\n",
       " \"A solid diner specializing in scratch-made breakfasts and sandwiches. The local who brought be here said that Monty's tries to use local meats, veggies, etc. and I applaud that (especially in Wisconsin where all the local stuff is typically top-notch). I tried the Wisconsin salmon breakfast hash that was tasty and I cleaned my plate, but the dish was just a tad dry and needed a little something extra to make it more than the minced and griddled sum of its parts. Breakfast potatoes were solid and didn't provoke the usual request for Cholula/Tabasco. I appreciated the fact that fresh fruit is offered as a side with most breakfasts. Definitely hit the spot. Our server was very attentive and was exceedingly patient with our sleep-deprived indecision before ordering.\\n\\nAfter glancing at the dessert case filled with ultra-decadent delights (cupcakes, cakes, etc.) I think I'd be up for returning on a future trip to Madison. A late-night sugar fix might be more in the cards than breakfast next time, though.\",\n",

But really good.\\n\\nWhile I personally loathe meatloaf as a rule, my sister stands by their meatloaf and meatloaf sandwich as being the best around. \\n\\nAlways popular with the veggie/vegan crowd for the multitude of imitation food offerings, I stick with the bacon.\",\n",

I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado.  For my side, I chose the bean salad.  Both of these items were delicious.  The sandwich was HUGE.  I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork.  A little messy, but totally worth it.  The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread.\\n\\nI got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she\\'s not vegan) because she \"trusts me\".  I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased.  My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma\\'s did not share that problem and it wasn\\'t difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.\\n\\nMy grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.\\n\\nThey seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.\\n\\nOverall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty\\'s.

Plenty of good vegetarian options also.\\n\\nFood is interesting, with lots of things not found in your typical diner.   Coffee is from Just Coffee (that is a bonus feature people - if you like coffee, this is a great place) and many of the specials are made with organic foods.  Want a burger but don\\'t eat meat?  Swap out the Walnut burger - which, as a meat eater, I can say is good.  Certainly better than their hamburger.  Speaking of which...\\n\\nWhat is up with that hamburger?  First off, it comes medium well done - no burger should ever be cooked to that.  Second, it is heavily, and funky seasoned.  As in, if I ordered it, it would go back.  A good burger needs salt and pepper.  They add a bunch of stuff.  However my niece who ordered it liked it, so we kept it.\\n\\nDeserts are very popular at Monty\\'s, but that was our disappointment.  Cheesecake was rubbery and the carrot cake was dry - stale dry.

I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\\n\\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.

We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.

I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they\\'re located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That\\'s outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That\\'s on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It\\'s at the front of the lumberyard.

       " 'I\\'ve been to the Harmony several times before, but last night was the first time I\\'ve been there for live music, and also the first time I tried their famed Walnut Burger.\\n\\nFirst, you should know that the Harmony is indeed a bar. If you go expecting an upscale \"gastro-pub\" experience of chic bar food, then you will be disappointed. There are no waiters, and you seat yourself. You order food and drinks at the bar, and  a food runner brings out your order when it\\'s ready. Its got a dive bar atmosphere, and the interior is pretty run down. \\n\\nAfter fighting for a table due to the crowd that was rapidly accumulating in anticipation of that evening\\'s band, my friends and I perused the menu. It contains primarily stereotypical bar food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc), but there are a few exceptions. There are several vegetarian options, including veggie nachos, so if you\\'re a non meat eater, you would probably find lots of things to order at The Harmony. Most notably, The Harmony offers a walnut burger. I\\'m told they\\'re famous for it, so I ordered the walnut burger with blue cheese and a side of homemade potato chips with \"Bleu Cheese Dip\". (What can I say, I really, really love Blue Cheese!) It took awhile for the food to come out, so we drank beer while we waited. Our table of about 10 people ordered 3 pitchers to share. I am not sure what all of them were, but in honor of the WI bar experience, I stuck to PBR. It was as good as PBR can be.\\n\\nOnto the food: The blue cheese walnut burger came topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce in addition to blue cheese crumbles, rather than plain blue cheese crumbles like I had been anticipating. It also came with onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The lettuce and tomato were exceptionally fresh and ripe looking. I was really impressed, especially by the tomato (it was actually red!). I bit into it and was immediately transported to blue cheese heaven. It was fantastic. I will qualify this praise with the statement that the reason I loved this burger so much was largely a result of the copious blue cheese flavor. I am not sure the walnut burger itself was why it tasted so great. The chips were also awesome. They arrived piping hot. Some were crunchy and others were chewier. It was clear that they were made to order. The Bleu Cheese Dip they came with was similar to what came on my burger, and as a result, was amazing. \\n\\nWe ate as the band played and just reveled in how fun the whole experience was. By the way, the band was great! It was a Rockabilly group called The Fast Clydes. If you like that style of music, I couldn\\'t recommend them more. They had a ton of energy and knew how to work the crowd. I had a blast. \\n\\nAll this said, there are a few things that I think The Harmony could improve upon. First off, the tables in the main dining area are plastic. They\\'re the exact same tables that you played beer pong on in college. I feel like The Harmony excels in spite of its dive bar atmosphere, and not necessarily because of it. Therefore, if they invested just a little bit of money to spruce up the interior, I think they would see a return. The Atwood area is still rocking that hippie vibe, for sure, but more and more, I am noticing newer and more upscale establishments. To me, that says that there\\'s probably a market for it and the times, they are a changin\\'. Also, I don\\'t mind ordering food and drinks at the bar. However, I think The Harmony would benefit from offering table service, at least during shows on Friday and Saturday night. I have only ever been to The Harmony with a group, and it sucks to have to walk away from the conversation to get another beer, a process which can take 10 or 15 minutes if it\\'s crowded. All-in-all, these drawbacks are minor, and I\\'ll be back at The Harmony many times this summer!',\n",

I asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides. He said-definitely the fries and the baked beans. The baked beans were delicious! Also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it. I just want to take the time right now to say that I hate beans-the consistency of it and the way that they\\'re often overloaded with lard/butter. As mentioned above, yummy and on top of that he said that if I didn\\'t like either of the sides he recommended to let him know and he would get me something else. \\n\\nI tried the ribs which were so soft that it basically came apart in my fingers, the sauce was consistent throughout.

Having two boys changing from BMX style to Mountain bikes, I had no idea what to look for size wise. Gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences. When each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most, Gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow. In comparing two other bikes stores, their sale prices were still more than Village Peddler everday prices, can you say mark-up!\\n\\nEach of the boys were taught how to assemble and dissasemble their tires making sure to check the brakes to allow them for a seamless ride.Gary went over this a couple times to make sure the boys were comfortable to do it on there own, then asked them both to do it by themselves. After about two times, they are pros! I was impressed as I sat back and watched the interaction between the boys, Gary, and newly joining in on the conversation; Mike. It was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with Gary and Mike like they had known them for years. It was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional. Both Gary and Mike spent about 25 minutes with them, which in this day and age doesn't happen in the big corporate run stores. I have been in customer service myself for over 20 years, so it definitely takes a lot to impress me! \\n\\nI have visited other bike stores where we were just treated like a number, when finally asked if we needed help it was if the clerk was being timed to make sure he could get back to the next person in line. When I am considering spending a large amount of money, if I am not impressed with your customer service, you have definitely lost the sale. In this case, we as a family were treated excellent, and coming from a guy in his 40's, I don't find many places that are willing to make a good personal experience great, but in the case it most definitely was. \\n\\nWe added several accessories to our purchase and all together spent far less than we would have elsewhere.

I could just stop for the soup. It is spicy, but not overbearing. There are chunks of potato and the soup is thick, but not too thick. It has the color of toast that is not too dark.

I think they stock 4 or 5 of those, and when they\\'re gone, they\\'re gone (they\\'re also about $1 higher than Woodman\\'s).\\n\\n- It\\'s inconvenient to get in and out of.  University Avenue S-U-C-K-S sucks.  And, if you wish to head west from Metcalfe\\'s, you have to turn onto Midvale, make a U-turn, and then sit at the Midvale/University light and wait... The parking lot is also a cluster-F.\\n\\n- The checkers can be a bit snooty.  That, or I get the same girl every time... it really does seem as though I\\'m bothering the heck out of her by giving her a handful of items to scan, waiting on a total, and then giving her money.  I usually encounter a \"why-are-you-bothering-me-with-this\" sigh or a roll of the eyes at some point during checkout.  \\n\\n- The clientele can be a bit snobby (especially the ones that hop out of their leased BMWs).  Yeah, so you think you\\'re cool in your BMW, but we both know that you\\'re living in a rundown apartment, using one credit card to pay the other, and you\\'re maybe 2-weeks from having the Bimmer repo\\'d.

I had read online to be wary of bakers who use a lot of filling to disguise dry or flavorless cake, and this is what we were experiencing again and again at the wedding show...until we found Carl's booth. We both tried a different kind, and we both decided on the spot that this bakery would be designing our cake.

(It's cake! You should be!) Because of the strange buttercream frosting, I've really had enough when I've eaten just one small slice.\\n\\nEvery instance in which I've had a slice of a Carl's Cakes cake was at my work (someone's birthday or other event). The cakes sat in the kitchen room at my work, ready for staff people to enjoy. The kitchen room itself smelled like butter with the cake sitting in the room. It is a sickly sweet smell and kind of nauseating, I think.

The rice 'n' peas were alright.. for some reason only my favorite place back home puts some coconut in the rice to cool down the jerk sauce. As far as the meats go, the chicken was great. It was deliciously flavored, moist, and falling off the bone. The sauce was really nice too.. very well balanced. They gave us extra in case we wanted a little more heat. I think they blend their own because there was a bottle with a picture of David on it at the cash register. There were two drumsticks and a small breast in the order. Boy's order of pork was very tender and flavored well again (almost like jamaican bbq, he said because it was pulled).

They make it to order. Because of this, it can hold up the meal, which the server will generally alert you about. My friend loves the fried colossal shrimp, which is awesome and also $$$. I generally get the cod, which is good. I doubt any of the fish is fresh, but perhaps on the weekends, it is. \\n\\nAll meals come with a salad. Get the blue cheese dressing.

I wish they would drop the cover charge down or at least offer some drink specials! \\n\\nThe bar has its own set of problems: I just hate spending $40 on drinks and not even getting a buzz out of it. It's hard enough to tell the bartender what you want over the music, but it's even harder when everything you ask for they don't have (or maybe they think they don't have it because they can't hear me?) Mind you I'm not picky or difficult, I just expect the bartender to know how to make the drink I want or at least stock  2 of the 3 beers I'm asking for.\\n\\nSolution for the Yelper: If you can, drink before you go.\\n\\nSeating: Maybe, just maybe, invest in another velvetine sectional or two. Club Pallazzo certainly charges enough for cover to afford a new couch. I like to rest my pretty feet after I'm done dancing and people watch, and maybe I don't feel like going on the patio.\\n\\nThe Ambiance: The inside is gorgeous. It's definitly the atmosphere that brings all the boot-stomping night owls out en masse. The frescoes on the walls and ceiling sport scantily clad vampiresses looking for a bite, and the velvet curtains that hang from the ceiling to the floor, along with the throne chairs give the club it's regal aire.\\n\\nThe Music: It's true, they have different DJ's switch off sets. The DJ I like also DJ's at Le Homme on Wed. nights. If I don't like what's playing I head outside for fresh air on the ample patio. But overall the music is good. \\n\\nI know some people that go every weekend. If I did that, I would be living in the alleyway behind Tranz.

For once, I was ready to go bright and early so that we could make the six-hour drive before the holiday weekend traffic got to be too terrible. My car, unfortunately, had other plans.  The battery, which I had purchased less than a month prior, decided it didn't want to work.  We suspected it was a bad connection to the terminal but couldn't be sure. Instead of driving to Checker Auto, I decided to take the car a couple blocks away to Virginia Auto.  I have a few friends who regularly take their vehicles here for service, so even though I had never utilized their serviced, I felt confident about taking my car in.\\n\\nAt 8am, their small lot was already packed, and I snagged the only available spot.  We walked in and were helped right away.  The very nice lady at the desk asked if I'd made an appointment ahead of time and I explained our situation.  She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.  After we got to Texas that afternoon, my very car-savvy Dad looked at the  car and said the battery had been installed very well - it was in securely and everything had been cleaned up really well.\\n\\nI need some serious maintenance done on the car, and I will absolutely be taking it in to Virginia Auto.  As soon as I do, I have no doubt I'll be coming back to this review to change it from a 4-star to a 5-star review.\\n\\nThank you, thank you, thank you, Virginia Auto, for taking such great care of me and my car and allowing us to head out of town for a few days without worrying about my car!\",\n",

Both had a really good bite to them without losing all of the different flavors in the dish.  That is something that gets lost at many Thai places, everything is so hot you lose the flavor.  Two of us had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend had the Salmon dish.  All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  Extremely rare to find in a Thai concept.  Love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept.  We will definitely be back as this will be our new home for Thai in the valley.',\n",

It wasn't great, but that's just my taste. I personally do not like my food battered in Peanut Sauce or whatever it's called. \\n\\nOh, and the bathroom here was atrocious.

I do realize I was eating outside in the desert though so I tried to let it go.\\n\\nThe service was pretty bad.  We had to ask for ice tea refills.  We had to ask for additional sweetner packets.

The corn fritters were other worldly, totally killer, I really enjoyed the tofu and the veggie rolls. What a great way to open up the meal.\\n\\nFor our meals, we split the Seafood Panang which was shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and salmon in a spicy red coconut sauce. The ONLY part I didn\\'t totally love was the calamari, it was waaaay chewy. Every other part was perfect. The shrimp were sweet and succulent, the scallops cooked to utter perfection, the mussels were done the was they\\'re supposed to be not chewy, tender) and the salmon was something to slap my mama over. \\n\\nThe other dish we had to split was the Merry Mu (grilled pork served with coconut rice and carrot \"relish\"). The pork was perfectly seasoned sliced large pork pieces, the coconut rice was a sticky ball of semi sweet rice (not my bag, but I think some people would like it) and the carrot relish was more like a sweet carrot salad. It did come with this really peculiar (in a good way) green salty/bitter sauce that I kept going back to. I realized a piece of the pork, with some of the sweet carrot salad and the sauce had the total package. Wow. \\n\\nWe ended the meal with a stiff cocktail (I had this cosmo thing with sake, cranberry and lime juice that I had them serve me in a regular cup instead of the martini glass so I didn\\'t look like a nancy) and wifey had a big ole slice of chocolate cake. Triple decker and all.\\n\\nWe ended up leaving around 720 or so, and the music was SUPPOSED to start at 7 but we didn\\'t get to see it.

Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.\\n\\nDragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.\\n\\nSatay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!\\n\\nWild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.\\n\\nVeggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.\\n\\nHot Pot:\\nWe also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.\\n\\nMain Course:\\nI had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!\\n\\nOnce again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.\\n\\nDesert:\\nOMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!\\n\\nWill I go back?\\nI wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.\\n\\nHats off to The Wild Thaiger.\\nThe best Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona.\",\n",

My companion loves, loves, loves things spicy, but when we both take a bite and can\\'t actually taste any flavors of the dish, just burning lava, well it is simply to hot.  When we called our server over to let him know that the dish was way to hot to be palatable he asked if we wanted it boxed up.  Um no, please just take it away.  He didn\\'t even ask if we wanted something different.\\nHere is the kicker, when he brought our check the dish was still on it.  I called him over and asked for him to remove it for the obvious reason that we sent it back.  His response, \"Ohhh sorry!  It does say spicy on the menu.\"  I couldn\\'t believe it.  I got charged $14.95 for a dish we couldn\\'t even eat.  Totally lame.  A manager didn\\'t even come over to try to smooth this issue out.

Wild Thaiger has had many TV personalities visit the place, but also celebrities that come by PHX.  I know because of the pictures posted in the back wall - haha!  Decorated with traditional Thai art; Wild Thaiger tries to emulate that Thailand feel along with your cuisine.  \\n\\nI've been here several times once for dinner and once for Happy Hour.  I'm a big fan of the fried noodles mainly Pad See Ew - Stir-fried fat noodles with your choice of protein; chicken, beef, or pork; and of course vegetables.  Seems pretty simple, but this dish packs a punch of aroma and spice.  It's usually fried in a garlic sauce and the amount of heat is based on how much you can handle.  I can't do the Thai spice I'll admit so I always do the medium.  In any case, Wild Thaiger deliveries with the Pad See Ew along with their traditional Pad Thai dish.  Another stir-fried noodle, but this one is with the skinny noodles and it's much sweeter.\\n\\nOverall, I would come here for Happy Hour because they have 1/2 off appetizers.  Their selection of Thai beer is always interesting something I think you need to try for you beer connoisseurs out there.

We started with the Island Crab, which is a crispy shell with crab meat on top - like a deconstructed wonton type of thing, only better! I love the fact that you can see and taste huge delicious chunks of crab, instead of the typical 95% cream cheese filling in most crab wontons. Awesome. For our \\'entree\\' we had a special for the evening that was Thai Sausage and vegetables. It was yummy, and I was even afraid to \\'dive in\\' because the presentation was gorgeous! \\n\\nIn previous experiences here I\\'ve had Pad Thai, Holy Basil Chicken, Peanut Passion and Beef Mangone. All of them were awesome, beautifully presented and my personal favorite... tasted FRESH! I love that every time I\\'ve been here the food has been consistently awesome.

From the moment my friend and I entered the restaurant the experience was bad. In hindsight, I should have walked out after our issues with the hostess. She repeatedly asked us where we would like to sit, or how many people were in our party, and then she would walk away while we answered or disregard that we had answered her at all. It was like she was incapable of absorbing information. We finally got seated. The table behind us very loudly cancelled their order paid for their drinks and left stating that the service taking too long. The writing was on the wall. At first, I felt like those people were incredibly rude, but now I wish that I had left too rather than enduring a total lack of service. \\nIt took a long time for us to get water or our drinks. We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our drinks, the appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive, the waiter forgot that we had ordered anything at all, came back to the table to confirm the appetizer TWICE and still brought us the wrong item and then had the nerve to charge us for it! I asked for menu suggestions, the waiter just stared at me blankly. I asked if I could have steamed rice rather than fried, he said that was impossible to change. Impossible. Eventually our entrees came, I ordered soup, it wasn't good. He brought out a teacup for me to use as my soup bowl. It was almost impossible to manage. Then our check came, he overcharged us. I didn't dispute anything because I just wanted to leave. I paid in cash, he shorted me five dollars. I called that his tip, and left. \\nThe restaurant was not busy, it was typical for a Wednesday night. There is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness. I found the menu to be limiting, and the items lacked enough description. I will never go back. I have no idea how it had such good reviews.\",\n",

That\\'s a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill.

Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!\\n5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.\\n6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.\\n7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be \"checked out\" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.\\n8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done.

We were staying at the Hyatt Regency on 2nd Street & Monroe, walking distance from the Arizona Center that is blessed with Sam's Cafe! \\nI can be a demanding customer due to my dietary needs. I am always in need of altering my menu selection and substituting items. Sam's wait staff & chef were extremely accommodating to me. I had the Fish Tacos on Saturday night with a full serving of steamed vegetables instead of the rice & beans it usually comes with. They also gave me the Chipotle sauce on the side and plenty of salsa... (GOOD salsa)!\\nWe were so pleased with our meal & service that on our last night in town we opted to return to Sam's Cafe knowing we would be satisfied with our meals and the menu has alot of goodies to choose from. I had the Salmon this time on a bed of veggies instead of sweet potatoes. I did let myself indulge in some of their tasty and chips with the chunky & tasteful salsa, (I just ran a marathon)! The chips themselves are very unique mixture of blue corn tortilla, sweet potato chips, and some other varieties...GOOD! \\nI will return on any visit to Phoenix!!\",\n",

The chips are great- a variety of veggie, tortilla, and won-ton chips mixed in one basket. The tortilla soup, quesadillas, and especially the carnitas plate are all highly recommended. The Orange Beso margarita is so delicious and so big we always split one. The seafood pasta was acceptable, which is almost high praise in Phoenix where most of the seafood we've had is downright nasty. We've never had room for dessert, but the white chocolate/pecan corn husk is the perfect little bit of sweet at the end of the meal. Prices are fair and the outdoor seating is cool, but can be a little loud when they are crowded and the waterfalls are running in the courtyard. The service has always been good to excellent.\",\n",

Thank you Manager of the restaurant for letting us stay!!\\n\\nWe basically had 5 minutes to look at the menu. Our waitress wanted us out ASAP. I didn't look at the menu carefully so I just picked something out of the Specialty section. \\n\\nAnyway, the chips and salsa were awesome!!! Our basket of chips had three varieties: corn tortilla, blue corn tortilla, and a sweet and spicy chip. I really liked the sweet and spicy chip since it tasted like a slightly spicy churro. Yum!  The salsa had a black bean flavor and chunks of tomatoes. Also yummy.\\n\\nThe food came out so quickly!! It took like 10 minutes for the food to come out. Haha.\\n\\nI had the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast. mMmMM.. the stuffing was so good!! I loved the herb-goat cheese mixed with the red pepper cream sauce and the cilantro pesto. The chicken was very moist! The asparagus wasn't too good, as it was chewy. However, the southwest rice pilaf was so creamy and had a smoky flavor. I also loved the extra touch of the tortilla chips on top of the dish. Lovely presentation!\\n\\nMy mom had the Chicken Penne Pasta with the cilantro pesto. The chicken was moist, and the pesto had a deep cilantro flavor. If you hate cilantro, stay away from this dish!! There was a tad bit too much olive oil, but the strong cilantro flavor was awesome!\\n\\nIt was a pleasant surprise to receive a frozen white chocolate tamale. YUMMY! I only eat white chocolate so I was so excited to eat this. Loved the nuts and the sweetness. \\n\\nAgain, our waitress was not very nice to us.

       " 'My two-star rating for Sam\\'s Cafe is based on our experience there for happy hour in the bar. If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I\\'ll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \\n\\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam\\'s Cafe. \\n\\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it\\'s ready so that it doesn\\'t get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn\\'t for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \\n\\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid\\'s and McCormick & Schmick\\'s are two great examples. \\n\\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don\\'t want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I\\'m crazy, but I don\\'t think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you\\'re having such a good time. As persuasive as his \"selling techniques\" were, we weren\\'t (having a good time), so we didn\\'t (order more).',\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed this place. I had some great grilled tuna with rice and veggies. It was cooked perfectly and the seasonings didn't overwhelm the tuna. Everyone else at the table got more traditional mexican dishes...tacos, fajitas etc. and they really seemed to enjoy them! I also had an AMAZING margarita. It was a specialty one with citrus flavors, I don't even like tequila but it was delicious. The outdoor seating area is beautiful. We ate surrounded by trees covered in twinkle lights, so pretty.\",\n",
       " \"After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\\n\\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\\n\\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\\n\\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\\n\\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \\n\\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.\",\n",

It was pretty good, but would have been better for a group of 6.\\n\\nI ordered the steak and cake for my main. It was a chile-rubbed sirloin accompanied by a big fat delicious crab cake.

       " \"I started out extremely hopeful because the basket of chips placed on the table were so good that I probably would have been satisfied not ordering an actual entree. As it turned our, I should have listened to my stomach. The basket of chips included blue corn, yellow corn, sweet potato and surprisingly the best of the bunch, fried won ton skins with Navajo spices. The salsa was pretty good though when my friend asked for something spicier, all they did was dump some cayenne pepper into the same salsa and serve it in a different shaped bowl.\\n\\nWe started with the cheap happy hour margarita, which was better than expected to their special Commemorativo margarita, which was served to us in the shaker. For the price, it was a lot of margarita with a lot of tequila and it was tasty. Can't beat that...except maybe with a couple of rounds of Patron.\\n\\n I knew I was in trouble, though, when I asked the waiter to recommend a vegetarian dish and he suggested the veggie pasta with black beans and ginger soy sauce. Not sure why I listened to him when every part of my being told me not to order pasta at a Mexican restaurant. But I did. My pasta came with three toothpick thin pieces of asparagus, one mushroom, two pieces of zucchini and a little pile of spinach. There were a few black beans hiding in the noodles which were slightly tinted brown, supposedly the Ginger soy sauce. It was the worst meal I have had in a very longtime and a total disappointment to say the least. I tried a piece of my friend's tuna and it was overbooked, try and bland.\\n\\nAll in all, this place got one star for their margaritas and one star for their chips. I may go back for drinks but will think twice, and probably even three times before I eat there again.\",\n",

I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.\\n\\nCanyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I\\'ve ever tasted. The food is mediocre.\\n\\nMy first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! \\n\\nMy fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace.

I didn\\'t know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I\\'m not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial \\'foot in the ass\\' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night.

The place was nearly empty, but that\\'s to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn\\'t in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.\\n\\nThis particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. \\n\\nI\\'m about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i\\'d like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I\\'m being rushed out again. I don\\'t touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that\\'s on my table,\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re not finished?\"\\n    No.\\n\"Just enjoying the weather?\"\\n    ..........\\n\\nI think I\\'m finished now. I\\'m finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school.

Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they\\'re made out of! \\n\\nThere could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver.

Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment.

But it\\'s allowed and it\\'s a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves. \\n\\nThere is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O\\'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O\\'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don\\'t complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it\\'s nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I\\'m so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.\\n\\nLike I said - it\\'s a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible.

I know of many great people who I personally feel should be \"let in\" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we\\'re obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.\\n\\nTo my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it\\'s own ways and unique culture.

We had an excellent tour guide who was part Navajo and part Hopi. In addition to giving us a broad overview of Native American history, he also gave us many insights into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions. As we toured through the galleries filled with basketry, ceramics, and Navajo blankets, he explained that a lot of the names \"given\" to the tribes by white settlers were simply the result of the two groups not understanding one another. For instance, the Pima tribe is so called because in response to the question, \"What are you called?\" the people answered, \"Pima,\" which means \"I don\\'t know\"--as in, I don\\'t know what you crazy people are asking me!\\n\\nMy friend and I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend visiting if you\\'re ever in Phoenix.',\n",

From the crafts to the history, the Heard Museum entertained even an 8 year old who really just wanted to play in the pool all day long. Fast forward a \"couple\" of years and I decided it was time to give this historical haven the grownup test. My friends, I was more than impressed.

Don\\'t worry about this being the case with the Heard Museum. They have done a fabulous job of keeping the museum up-to-date, clean and full of great ways for all ages to learn about the Native American culture in Arizona. \\n\\nSome highlights include:\\n\\n1. Interactive. The Heard created great displays with information and an interactive game for children...or children at heart. \\n\\n2. Visual dessert for the eyes. They don\\'t cheat you on historical artifact exhibits which shows that they have a nice group of donors who are eager to keep the museum alive and visually stimulating. \\n\\n3. Family-fun for everyone. I saw a brochure marketing family-fun days every Saturday in July. Activities include, interactive games, crafts, live performances, etc. \\n\\n4. AZ Resident Friendly. The admission price was $12 and I cringed a little, but then as if I was meant to get a little cultured that day, they told me that AZ residents receive free admission every second Sunday of the month. Not a bad way to take care of the residents melting in the heat! \\n\\n5. Cafe food you actually want to eat. To make the most of the day, I ate at the cafe and took advantage of the 85 degree weather while it still lasted. The food...was good. I had a warm turkey and brie sandwich on homemade cranberry bread with the corn pasta salad.

I think that comes from the fact that most of the pieces were from a private collection that was donated rather than being cultivated and collected selectively as in most museums.\\n\\nOverall, it's not my favorite museum in the city.

Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.\\n\\nBut while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  The place is typically packed and it's not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).

I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special.\\n\\nMy only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.

There were also no food samples. Why did we buy pub crawl wristbands again? \\n\\nWe attempted to make up for the slowly-worsening pub crawl experience by ordering vodka shots. There was some miscommunication between the bartenders because when the girl we ordered them from disappeared and another bartender approached us to ask if we needed help, we somehow ended up with two rounds of shots. Naturally, we didn't want to pay for both, a statement that got us quite a bit of attitude from the bartenders. The mistake wasn't entirely their fault (we could have been clearer, I supposed), but I could have done without the 'tude, especially since you can just pour vodka back into a bottle.

       "[\"I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.\",\n",

    "1. You can use the \"does this word present in this document\" as a normalization scheme, which means the values are always 1 or 0.  So we give no additional weight to the presence of the word multiple times.\n",

    "1. By default, the [`HashingVectorizer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer.html) normalizes the counts using an L-2 norm. If you go this route, keep in mind that `HashingVectorizer` doesn't support `min_df`  and `max_df`. However, it's not hard to roll your own transformer that solves for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try using the log of the number of counts (or more precisely, $log(x+1)$). This is often used because we want the repeated presence of a word to count for more but not have that effect tapper off.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) is a common normalization scheme used in text processing.  Use the [`TfidfTransformer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer). There are options for using `idf` and taking the logarithm of `tf`.  Do these significantly affect the result?\n",

Because we are dealing with a sparse matrix, we have to use [`TruncatedSVD`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD.html#sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD).  If we reduce the dimensions, we can use a more sophisticated models than linear ones.\n",

Playing with the number of features, using the `HashingVectorizer`, incorporating `min_df` and `max_df` limits, and handling stop-words in some way are all methods of addressing this issue. If you are using `CountVectorizer`, it is possible to run it with a fixed vocabulary (based on a training run, for instance). Check the documentation.\n",

This allows you to focus your efforts on improving the important algorithms, and leaving the rest \"good enough\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to accomplish this is through ceiling analysis, which can be useful when you have a training set with ground truth values at each stage. Let's say you're training a model to extract image captions from websites and return a list of names that were in the caption. Your overall accuracy at some point reaches 70%. You can try manually giving the model what you know are the correct image captions from the training set, and see how the accuracy improves (maybe up to 75%). Alternatively, giving the model the perfect name parsing for each caption increases accuracy to 90%. This indicates that the name parsing is a much more promising target for further work, and the caption extraction is a relatively smaller factor in the overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know the right answers at different stages of the pipeline, you can still evaluate how important different parts of the model are to its performance by changing or removing certain steps while keeping everything else constant. You might try this kind of analysis to determine how important adding stopwords and stemming to your NLP model actually is, and how that importance changes with parameters like the number of features."

    "We want to find collocations --- that is, bigrams that are \"special\" and appear more often than you'd expect from chance. We can think of the corpus as defining an empirical distribution over all *n*-grams.  We can find word pairs that are unlikely to occur consecutively based on the underlying probability of their words. Mathematically, if $p(w)$ be the probability of a word $w$ and $p(w_1 w_2)$ is the probability of the bigram $w_1 w_2$, then we want to look at word pairs $w_1 w_2$ where the statistic\n",

    "\n",
    "is high.  Return the top 100 (mostly food) bigrams with this statistic with the 'right' prior factor (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating the probabilities is simply a matter of counting, and there are number of approaches that will work.  One is to use one of the tokenizers to count up how many times each word and each bigram appears in each review, and then sum those up over all reviews.  You might want to know that the `CountVectorizer` has a `.get_feature_names()` method which gives the string associated with each column.  (Question for thought: Why doesn't the `HashingVectorizer` have a similar method?)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Questions:* This statistic is a ratio and problematic when the denominator is small.  We can fix this by applying Bayesian smoothing to $p(w)$ (i.e. mixing the empirical distribution with the uniform distribution over the vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does changing this smoothing parameter affect the word pairs you get qualitatively?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can interpret the smoothing parameter as adding a constant number of occurrences of each word to our distribution.  Does this help you determine set a reasonable value for this 'prior factor'?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For fun: also check out [Amazon's Statistically Improbable Phrases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistically_Improbable_Phrases).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Implementation note:*\n",
    "As you adjust the size of the Bayesian smoothing parameter, you will notice first nonsense phrases being removed and then legitimate bigrams being removed, leaving you with only generic bigrams.  The goal is to find a value of the smoothing parameter between these two transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference solution is not an aggressive filterer: it errors in favor of leaving apparently nonsensical words. On further consideration, many of these are actually somewhat meaningful. The smoothing parameter chosen in the reference solution is equivalent to giving each word 30 previous appearances prior to considering this data.  This was chosen by generating a list of bigrams for a range of smoothing parameters and seeing how many of the bigrams were shared between neighboring values.  When the shared fraction reached 95%, we judged the solution to have converged.  Note that `min_df` should not be set too high, where it could exclude these borderline words."
